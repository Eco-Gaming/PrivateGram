# PrivateGram

This is currently an unfinished, super basic app that uses [Proxigram](https://codeberg.org/ThePenguinDev/Proxigram) as a backend to fetch data from Instagram. Contributions are greatly appreciated!

If you want to try this app you will have to manually set a Proxigram instance URL in `app/src/main/java/me/ecogaming/privategram/network/ProxigramNetwork.kt`.

Disclaimer: I don't know much about Android App development, so this is more of project for learning and might not turn out to be all that great of an app.

## Roadmap
- ~~display 3 wide grid with posts on profile view~~ done
- Post view
- implement settings
	- theme
	- instance selector
- implement search for tags
- lock button and textfield while loading profile
- PullRefreshLayout for feeds?
- ...
- cache results, etc. for more efficient operation
