# PrivateGram

This is currently an unfinished, super basic app that uses [Proxigram](https://codeberg.org/ThePenguinDev/Proxigram) as a backend to fetch data from Instagram.

## Roadmap
- display 3 wide grid with posts on profile view (-> PullRefreshLayout)
- implement settings
	- theme
	- instance selector
- implement search for tags
